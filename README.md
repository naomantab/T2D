# Project Overview

This software was developed by "Jammy Jelly" student group of Queen Mary University of London for the purpose of a software development projects as part of the MSc Bioinformatics Program.

This project involves the development of a **web-based software tool** to handle **molecular biology data**. The primary goal is to create an application that retrieves and integrates **single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)** associated with **Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)** and visualizes relevant population genomic and functional data.

## üß™ Website features
- Retrieve **SNP information** based on:
  - SNP ID (rs value)
  - Genomic coordinates (chromosome, start, and end)
  - Mapped gene name
- Display the following details for each SNP:
  - SNP name and genomic position
  - p-value from association tests
  - Mapped gene(s)
  - Summary statistics of **positive selection** for at least two South Asian populations
- **Gene ontology analysis:**
  - Select a mapped gene to retrieve functional/ontology terms
- **Population-level analysis:**
  - Select populations of interest
  - Display **descriptive statistics**
  - **Visualize summary statistics** for positive selection across genomic regions
- **Exportable results:**
  - Download a text file containing summary statistics (average & standard deviation)

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **Database:** SQL (MySQL)
- **Data Sources:**
  - [GWAS Catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas)
  - [T2D Knowledge Portal](https://t2d.hugeamp.org)
  - [International Genome Sample Resource](https://www.internationalgenome.org/)
  - [Gene Ontology Database](https://geneontology.org/)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/naomantab/T2D.git
   cd T2D
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Set up the database:
   ```sh
   flask db upgrade  # For Flask
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   flask run  # For Flask
   ```
